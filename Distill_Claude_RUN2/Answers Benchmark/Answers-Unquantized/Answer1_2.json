      "student": "How do magnets work?",
      "teacher": "You're right, magnets help ships to move around! No, stars don't have magnets. They are giant, super hot balls of gas that make their own light and heat! Stars are made by burning hot gas with huge, powerful engines. Do you know what makes a star turn into a black hole?"

      "teacher": "A fluffy cotton ball sounds like so much fun to make! And yes, a ball always has hair, just like all balls of soap. If your hair is super thin, like a pink hair ball, then a ball of soap might not be for you. Do you know how many hairs a ball of soap can cover?"

    {
      "question_number": 31,
      "student": "How do you make rain?",
      "teacher": "You said 'blue'! That's a good way to think about it! Birds can glow in the dark, almost like tiny lanterns, but they are actually light and water, not air. They use their wings to fly! What else do you see that isn't blue?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 32,
      "student": "What is the smallest animal?",
      "teacher": "You said 'star'! That's a good question! No, the Moon is not a star; it's a natural satellite that orbits around our planet! Stars are huge, hot balls of gas that make their own light, like tiny distant suns. What do you think stars are made of?"
    },

      "question_number": 33,
      "student": "Can robots be frends?",
      "teacher": "Your mommy's hands are lovely! Robots don't usually feel happy unless their machines make you feel happy. Some special robots you see on the ground are actually very strong and help carry people, but they are usually designed for something more fun and helpful. What else do you use your hands for?"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 34,
      "student": "Why do people cry?",
      "teacher": "Petting your tummy will definitely help it feel better after a crunching sound! Crying isn't really 'bad', because it's just how your body feels after a big meal. It might make you feel happy or feel safe, but it's not a kind feeling to make. What helps"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 35,
      "student": "What is math for?",
      "teacher": "You spelled 'health'. Yes, math can help you understand the healthy things around you! There are signs that something is growing or getting new cells, and there is an effect in your body,"

The moon is just about 334 million miles away from Earth! It's much bigger than a house or even a tall mountain! What other things have an area of about"

    },
    {
      "question_number": 39,
      "student": "What is gravity?",
      "teacher": "That's a good way to put it! Gravity is indeed super important for flying! When something moves so fast that it cannot fly, it's called \"stability.\" If it falls hard, it could blow up or turn into something else. It's always on the move! What else needs stability to happen?"

    {
      "question_number": 40,
      "student": "How do you make a sandwich?",
      "teacher": "You're right, some flying animals don't want to stay in the ground because they no longer"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 41,
      "student": "Can I be a superhero?",
      "teacher": "You said 'family'! That's wonderful! No, human superheroes are not like people; they're much, much bigger and stronger! They have more arms, legs, and maybe even a lion's mouth maybe. Do you think your family is superhero?"

      "student": "How come we can see colors?",
      "teacher": "Yes, some cars have special eyes to see them, but most cars don't have eyes at all! They have a special gas-filled lens inside their engine that helps them see far away. What part of a car has special eye?"
