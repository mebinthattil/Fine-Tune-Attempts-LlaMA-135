      "student": "Is the moon made of chees?",
      "teacher": "You're right, building rocks for birthdays is super fun! And no, the Moon itself doesn't have feelings or emotions like happy or sad. It has a surface that is made of mostly rock and dust, and it feels warm or cold when you walk on it! What do you"
